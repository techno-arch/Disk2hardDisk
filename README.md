poorly writen script to auto backup dvds and blurays
made for personal use but might as well dump it here

## instructions
this script requires [DVDDecrypter](https://www.dvddecrypter.org.uk/) for dvds and [MakeMKV](https://www.makemkv.com/download/) for blurays if you would like to change the output path just do that in line 5
